MVP

Down the Road
* SQL Server Database or Firebase
* Auth
* User dashboard for invoices, downloads and support

## Design
The design of this website hasn't been finalized (as of 7/13/2022) but I want it to be clean and user friendly, with a modern look.

## Purpose
This website serves two purposes

### 1: Freelance Business
By optimizing SEO, building an attractive and usable website and making the process convienant and understandable, I can limit the barriers that small business owners in my area have put up. As my area grows, the demand for an online presence will is growing more as well, and companies must embrace the internet to survive

## 2: Build My Skillset
Most of my training has revolved around front-end development, and I have done a little bit of work with Auth, Firebase and .Net, but I want to get into backend so that I can build and own an entire application. I need to get better at alot of features of Next.js (the best JavaScript framework), particularly its backend features (Next.js is a backend framework with the best implementation of React). This will boost my portfolio while I try to find Full Time Employment.
